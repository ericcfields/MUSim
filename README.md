Code to conduct simulation studies examining power and Type I error rate for various mass univariate approaches and traditional mean amplitude approaches for event-related potential (ERP) data. These simulations use real EEG noise and real ERP effects.

Simulations are conducted using the Factorial Mass Univariate Toolbox:
